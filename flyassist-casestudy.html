        <p>Fly Assist</p>
        <p class="lead">This is a case study I created to help users book trips and flights without hassle</p>
        <p>I used Figma to create a mockup of the prototype for FlyAssist.</p>

      <p class="lead">As a user researcher, I want to understand the pain points people have as they plan for traveling.</p> 
      </p> After conducting a few user interviews, I realized that users struggle with slow online service and have a hard time planning, 
      <p>which makes users have an overall negative experience. </p> <br> </br>

<p>  Problem Statement:FlyAssist was designed to achieve seamless travel booking for travelers.</p> 
    <p>We have observed that users were frustrated with slow customer service and the lack of affordable travel options</p>
    <p>How might we operate FlyAssist so that our users are satisfied based on reviews and app activity?</p> <br> </br>

<div class="jumbotron"
   <p class="lead"> Based on the user testing results, I went an added additions such as a page that lists out all of 
    your planned excursions. </p>
    <p> Another interation I implemented was linking the sign-in page with your existing email, for a smoother login process</p>
